The materials in this repository include the following

1. UD_argumenthood_Neophilogica.R

R code used to analyze data extracted from UD treebanks.

2. Russian_data_with_encoding.xlsx

Input data for the analysis. The data were extracted from UD treebanks in October 2024 and preannotated semi-manually as described in the text of the paper.
This spreadsheet contains 132221 entries each corresponding to a verb dependent token.  

3. valency_frames.xlsx

A summarizing table showing clauses, their head verbs and 1/0 for the observed / non-observed encoding devices.
This spreadsheet contains 89797 entries each corresponding to a clause token.

4. verbs_and_encoding_devices.xlsx

A summarizing table showing frequencies of combinations for verb types and encoding devices.
This spreadsheet contains 7538 entries each corresponding to a verb lemma (type). 

5. argumenthood_df.xlsx

A summarizing table showing whether combinations of encoding devices and verb lemmas are interpreted as arguments by the algorithm.
This spreadsheet contains 7538 entries each corresponding to a verb lemma (type).

6. data.xlsx

The main spreadsheet generated by the argument-annotating algorithm.
This spreadsheet contains 122551 entries each corresponding to a verb dependent token.

7. data_with_dictionary_annotations.xlsx

An excerpt from the previous spreadsheet (5423 entries from data.xlsx) additionally annotated manually for the argumenthood status as given in dictionaries.
