| s   | 1             | The dictionary mentions the dependent with the relevant semantic role but does not specify the exact encoding device, or it specifies an encoding device that differs from the one observed in the treebank.                      | The verb bruznut’ ‘spray’ is described as having a three-argument pattern, with A3 denoting the goal participant, but the specific prepositional phrase found in the treebank token—na + accusative—is not specified.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| c   | 0             | The dictionary does mention the encoding device observed in the treebank token, but the corresponding pattern clearly has a different meaning from that found in the treebank.                                                    | The verb bombit’ ‘bomb’ is described as having a pattern with an instrumental dependent denoting the objects bombed. However, the actual treebank token features an instrumental dependent functioning as a temporal adverbial (dnjom ‘during the day’).                                                                                                                                       |
| r   | 0, 1          | The verb encountered in the treebank is not included in the dictionary, but the dictionary provides a description of the relevant verb’s (non-)reflexive counterpart, making it possible to infer the argument status of the dependent observed in the treebank. | The verb venčat'sja ‘have a church wedding’ is not included in the dictionary, but the relevant usage of venčat' ‘perform a church wedding’ makes it possible to infer that the s ‘with’ + instrumental prepositional phrase corresponds to an argument.                                                                                                                                      |
| p   | 0, 1          | The verb encountered in the treebank is not included in the dictionary, but the dictionary provides a description of the relevant verb’s aspectual counterpart, making it possible to infer the argument status of the dependent observed in the treebank. | The imperfective verb vbivat’ ‘drive in, hammer’ does not have a separate dictionary entry, but inferences about its arguments can be made based on the entry for its perfective counterpart vbit’.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| m   | 1             | The representation of the government pattern in the dictionary contains a technical error (possibly a typo), but the examples provided make it possible to unequivocally determine whether the dependent observed in the treebank was analyzed as part of the government pattern. | The government pattern of bajukat’ ‘lull’ is described as involving a dependent in the genitive (!) case, but the examples show accusative objects (e.g., bajukat’ mladenca ‘lull a baby’), which matches the usage observed in the treebank.                                                                                                                                                     |
